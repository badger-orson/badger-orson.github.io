    <p>To see the sanbox code running just look at the console. This is how I am testing the working code.</p>

        What is JSON? Json is a notation for Java Script objects. 
        <br />
        JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
        JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.
        <br />
        <b>It uses the Name/Values pairs.</b>
        <br />
        It makes it easier to send info from a server and then you can parse that
        info and turn it into an object or you could stringify an object you have created
        in Javascript. Meaning you put it back into the JSON syntax of the string.
